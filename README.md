# Curated Collection Website

A beginner-friendly website template for showcasing curated content.

## Files in this project:

- **index.html** - The main HTML file that contains the structure of your website
- **styles.css** - The CSS file that controls how your website looks
- **README.md** - This file (documentation)

## How to use:

1. Open `index.html` in a web browser to see your website
2. Replace all `[PLACEHOLDER: ...]` text with your actual content
3. Replace image placeholders with actual images
4. Customize colors and styles in `styles.css` if desired

## Adding Images:

To add images:
1. Create an `images` folder in this directory
2. Put your image files in that folder
3. Replace the placeholder divs with: `<img src="images/your-image.jpg" alt="Description">`

## Customization Tips:

- **Colors**: Look for color codes like `#667eea` in `styles.css` and change them to your preferred colors
- **Fonts**: Change the `font-family` in the `body` section of `styles.css`
- **Spacing**: Adjust `padding` and `margin` values to change spacing

## Notes:

- All code is heavily commented to help beginners understand what each part does
- The website is responsive and will work on mobile devices
- Feel free to add more sections or items as needed
